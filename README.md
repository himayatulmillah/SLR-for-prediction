# SLR-for-prediction
This is my first code in R language for data science while following Course-Net x Shopee workshop.

The dataset is about house prices in Bojosoang-Bandung that inputed by workshop participant to google form. The dataset contain house <code>house areas</code> as <b>independent variable</b> and <code>house prices</code> as <b>dependent variable</b>.

We didn't go through the cleaning process because the dataset was clean, so we passed it to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Modeling with Simple Linear Regression and Forecasting.

<code>script.Rmd</code> is the source code file and <code>script.nb.html</code> is the output file in html extension
